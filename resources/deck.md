# Foundational models

- GPT
- BERT
- Mistral

---

# Foundational models

- These are a starting place
- From here, we can fine-tune
- We can then deploy these ourselves, or use hosted solutions

---

# What does it mean to fine-tune?

- Essentially, "teach" a complex model to do a specific task.
- Typically done through reinforcement learning.

---

# I really wish there was an open-source option for this...

## 🤗

---

# Hugging Face

- GitHub, but for models 🎉

---

# Deployment

- `Spaces` allow you to host demos of ML apps
  - Obviously, not ideal for real-world use cases
- Use an off-the-shelf rack?
- Hosted options [like GCP's Vertex AI](https://cloud.google.com/vertex-ai/docs/start/introduction-unified-platform),
  [Azure OpenAI](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/ai-services/openai/how-to/create-resource?pivots=web-portal), etc.
